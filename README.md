## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
In this project we analyze past data of loan defaults from a consumer finance company to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default and provide recommendations. Based on the results, the company may take actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

The dataset is a csv formatted file containing thousands of records in which each record contains information about a loan applicant. For each applicant details about the loan such as loan amount, interest rate, tenure, status (paid/deliquent) etc are present in the file.


## Conclusions
- Applicants who are employed with annual income above 60K with short term (36 months) loan are the ones who are least likely to default on loan
- For applicants with annual income up to 60K, reducing the monthly installment amount by 200-400 from the current maximum could reduce default rate significantly
- For applicants with annual income up to 60K, reducing the loan amount by 4000-8000 from the current maximum could reduce default rates significantly
- Income verification is not useful and can be avoided
